Dispatcher Servlet is the front controller of spring MVC, and is used to dispatch
HTTP requests to other controlers.


What is ViewResolver and View?
The Spring MVC defines ViewResolver and View interfaces which enable us to
render models in a browser without forcing us to use specific view technology.

View REsolver procides mapping between view names and actual views.


What are mvc request processing steps?
1. Dispatcher servlet(DS) receives a request from a browser.
2. DS needs to identify which controller will handle the request, so it uses handler mapping
to find the correct controller.
3. Handler mapping returns the specific handler method that handles the request.
For example /hello mapping returns a hello() method.
4. DS calls the specific handler method - the method in the controller is called.
5. The handler method returns model and a view name.
6. Now the DS had view name, but it still needs to determine the view file to use.
To determine the view file it find the view resolver and calls it using the logical view name.
7. After the View Resolver(VR) receives the logical view name (step 6), it needs to find a .jsp file.
After finding the jsp file the VR returns it to the DS.
8. DS executes the view received from VR.
9. The view is rendered and it than returns the content back to DS.
10. DS sends the response back to the browser, after which we can see the page in the browser.


What is a ModelInterface?

A Model interface defines a holder for Model Attributes and is primarily designed
for adding attributes to the model. Now that model is exposed to the view, which means
that we can access the attributes in our jsp files.


What is a model?

In general a model represents data that will be passed from a controller method
to the view, as well as data passed from the view back to the controller method
where the forms included in the view.


What is and how to use @RequestParam annotation?

When we use parameter annotation a parameter is required (duuh).
With query parameters we can pass data from the browser into controller method.
Spring will automatically bind the query parameters so that we can use them in a method.
